#Q1. Calculate the average monthly electricity bill for a three-month period with bills of $28, $45, and $72. Write an expression to calculate the mean, and use print() to view the result.
Jan = 28
Feb = 45
Mar = 72
Avg = round((Jan + Feb + Mar) / 3) #Round a floating-point value
print('My average monthly electricity bill is $' + str(Avg) + '.') #Convert Avg from floating-point to string

My average monthly electricity bill is $48.

#Q2. A tiler needs to tile two rectangular areas of a floor. One area is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, and the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles are sold in packages of 6.
# Part 1: Calculate the total number of tiles needed for both areas.
# Part 2: If the tiler buys 17 packages of tiles, how many tiles will be left over?
Area_A = 9 * 7
Area_B = 5 * 7
Tiles_Needed = Area_A + Area_B
print('Total number of tiles needed for both areas would be: ' + str(Tiles_Needed))

Total_Tiles_Purchase = 17 * 6
Left_Over_Tiles = Total_Tiles_Purchase - Tiles_Needed
print('Number of titles left over would be ' + str(Left_Over_Tiles))

Total number of tiles needed for both areas would be: 98
Number of titles left over would be 4
