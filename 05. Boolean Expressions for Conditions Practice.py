Q1. 
Create two if statements that determine a winner's prize based on their total points. The points are stored in the integer variable points. 
1st conditional statement updates the prize to the correct name based on points.
2nd conditional statement sets the result to the correct string message based on whether the prize is evaluated as True or False. 
If they had won a prize, state "Congratulations! You won a [prize name]!", if not state "Oh dear, no prize this time.".

0: None
1 - 50: Lollipop
51 - 150: Protein Bar
151 - 180: Wafer Mint
181 - 200: Box of Chocolate

points = 0 #Use this input to make your submission
prize = 'None' #Set prize to default value of None

if points < 0:  #Points are invalid
    prize = 'None'
elif 1 <= points <=50:
    prize = "Lollipop"
elif 51 <= points <= 150:
    prize = "Protein Bar"
elif 151 <= points <= 180:
    prize = "Wafer Mint"
elif 181 <= points <= 200:
    prize = "Box of Chocolate"

if prize != 'None':
    result = "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize)
else:
    result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."

print(result)
