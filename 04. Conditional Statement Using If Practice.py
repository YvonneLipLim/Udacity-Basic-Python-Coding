Q1. 
Create an if-elif-else statement that determines a winner's prize based on their total points. The points are stored in the integer variable points. 
In the conditional statement, assign the result variable in a string message based on the value of points. If they had won a prize, state "Congratulations! You won a [prize name]!", if not state "Oh dear, no prize this time.". 
1 - 50: No Prize
51 - 150: Protein Bar
151 - 180: Wafer Mint
181 - 200: Box of Chocolate

points = 90 #Use this to run your code
if points <= 50:
  result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."
elif points <=150:
  result = "Congratulations! You won a Protein Bar!"
elif points <=180:
  result = "Congratulations! You won a Wafer Mint!"
else:
  result = "Congratulations! You won a Box of Chocolate!"
print(result)

Q2. Create a conditional statement to inform user about how their guess compares to the answer. Inform the user if their guess is too high or too low. 
Use looop to allow users to make multiple guesses until they guess the correct answer.

answer = 30 #provide answer
guess = 51 #provide guess

while guess != answer:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
if guess < answer:
    result = "Oops!  Your guess was too low."
elif guess > answer:
    result = "Oops!  Your guess was too high."
else:
    result = "Nice!  Your guess matched the answer!"

print(result)

Guess the number:  35
Guess the number:  30
Nice!  Your guess matched the answer!
